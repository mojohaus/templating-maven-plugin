Filtering a source folder

 The Templating Maven Plugin <<filter-sources>> goal lets you filter a dedicated source folder.
 In one pass, it filters that folder and adds the resulting filtered folder to the POM model
 as a source folder.

 If, for example, you have some of your code where you would like to reference properties coming
 from the POM, you want to put those classes inside the <<<sourceDirectory>>> tag.

 <<<Please note that filtering the standard src/main/java folder is not supported.>>>

	            But as the Maven philosophy is strongly about conventions, 
	            it's better to just not specify them.
