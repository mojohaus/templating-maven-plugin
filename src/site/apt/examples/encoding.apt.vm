Specifying a character encoding scheme

 A character encoding scheme such as <<<ASCII>>>, <<<UTF-8>>> or <<<UTF-16>>> can be chosen to be
 used for the reading and writing of files.

 For example, if we want to specify that the character encoding scheme be <<<UTF-8>>>,
 we would simply have to configure that as in the following example:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
  </properties>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>templating-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
